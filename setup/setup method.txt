Setup graphics.h in VS Code (MinGW)

Step 1: Copy the graphics library source files

Go to the graphics.h_solution folder.

Copy the files graphics.c and winbgim.c.

Paste them into the include folder of your MinGW installation.
Example: C:\MinGW\include\

Step 2: Copy the graphics library binary file

From the same graphics.h_solution folder, copy libbgi.a.

Paste it into the lib folder of your MinGW installation.
Example: C:\MinGW\lib\

Step 3: Install VS Code extensions

Open VS Code.

Install the Code Runner extension.

Install the Executor Runner extension (optional but recommended for running .exe files easily).

Step 4: Configure Code Runner to compile graphics programs

Open VS Code settings and search for Code Runner: Executor Map.

Edit the C++ (cpp) section and replace it with the following command:

"cpp": "cd $dir && g++ $fileName -o $fileNameWithoutExt -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32 && $dir$fileNameWithoutExt"

This ensures Code Runner compiles your C++ graphics programs with all required libraries.
